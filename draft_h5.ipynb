        "The Newton-Raphson method is named after Isaac Newton; the man who discovered the method in 1736, and Joseph Raphson, the man who described the method back in 1690. Both mathematicians utilized calculus in this method in order to find the roots of an equation\n",
        "\n",
        "The Newton-Raphson method, a fundamental technique in numerical analysis, plays a pivotal role in approximating roots of real-valued functions. This iterative approach provides an efficient means of finding solutions to equations where explicit solutions may be challenging or impractical to obtain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Central to its significance is the method's ability to converge rapidly towards the root of a function. By iteratively refining an initial guess, the Newton-Raphson method demonstrates remarkable efficiency in solving nonlinear equations. This method is particularly valuable in diverse fields such as physics, engineering, and finance, where numerical approximations are frequently employed to solve complex problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Formula ##\n",
        "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative numerical technique used for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function. Given a function $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$,The Newton-Raphson iteration formula is given by:  $ \\;x_{n+1}$ = $x_{n}$ - $ \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} $\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "$ \\;x_{n+1}$ is the next approximation,\n",
        "$\\;x_{n}$ is the current approximation, $\\;f(x_n)$ is the function value at $\\;x_{n}$\n",
        "$\\;f'(x_n)$is the derivative of the function at $\\;x_{n}$\n",
        "## Convergence Criteria ##\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Newton-Raphson method to converge,$\\;x_{0}$ the initial guess\n",
        "should be close to the actual root, and the function\n",
        "$f(x)$ must be continuous and have a continuous derivative in the neighborhood of the root. The convergence criteria can be stated using the error term:\n",
        "\n",
        "|$ \\;x_{n+1}$ -  $x_{n}$|  $\\; \\le$ $\\;ϵ$\n",
        "\n",
        "where\n",
        "ϵ is a small positive number, indicating the desired level of accuracy. Another common criterion is to check that  |$f(\\;x_{n+1})$ |  $\\; \\le$ $\\;ϵ$  \n",
        "The convergence rate of the Newton-Raphson method is quadratic, which means that the number of correct digits roughly doubles with each iteration when it is converging.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Potential Limitations ##\n",
        "While the Newton-Raphson method is a powerful tool for finding roots, it is important to consider its limitations and ensure that the chosen initial guess and function properties align with the method's requirements for convergence:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dependency on Initial Guess:\n",
        "The Newton-Raphson method is sensitive to the choice of the initial guess. If the initial guess is far from the actual root or is in a region where the function has a flat slope, the method may fail to converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Convergence to Local Minimum:\n",
        "The method is not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum; it might converge to a local minimum or a saddle point.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discontinuity and Singularities:\n",
        "If the function has discontinuities or singularities in the vicinity of the root, the method may behave unpredictably.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Need for Derivative:\n",
        "The method requires the calculation of the derivative, which may not always be readily available or computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Divergence:\n",
        "The Newton-Raphson method can diverge, especially if the derivative is close to zero or if the iterations lead to a division by zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Not Suitable for Multiple Roots:\n",
        "If the function has multiple roots, the method may converge to any of them, and the choice of the initial guess becomes crucial."
